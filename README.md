# MEDATA

`Medata` is a data set of Mediterranean fish census surveys conducted along the Mediterranean sea. The dataset includes environmental variables as well as conservation information regarding MPAs.

Environmental information (temperature, salinity and primary production) was acquired from [Bio-ORACLE](http://http://www.bio-oracle.org) using `sdmpredictors` package.

Fish traits data ("fish_traits.csv" including: Size, Mobility, Activity, Schooling, Position, Diet) were aqcuired from [GASPAR](http://cesab.org/index.php/en/projets-passes/28-gaspar) and [Trait structure reveals the processes underlying fish establishment in the Mediterranean O Givan, V Parravicini, M Kulbicki, J Belmaker - Global ecology and biogeography, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12523). For some species no data was available, therefore they are not included.

This is a collaboration of [Belmaker Lab](https://belmaker.weebly.com/) (Tel Aviv University, Israel), [Ernesto Azzuro](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ernesto_Azzurro) (ISPRA, Italy), [Joachim Claudet](http://www.joachimclaudet.com/) (CNRS, France) and [Enric Sala](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Enric_Sala).
